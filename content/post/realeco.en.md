May I make the best of what is given me today, living thoroughly the life I have without denying what this life suggests.

May I accept failure without ever accepting defeat, never giving up even after it is already too late.

Though I suffer, let my suffering not be the vacant hunger of those who live only to consume because they have given up hope.

Please let me see my hope today.
